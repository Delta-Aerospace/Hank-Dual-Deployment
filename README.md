# Hank Flight Computer
Introducing the Hank R1, a GPS enabled, 32-bit RISC-V Xtensa, flight computer meant specifically for servo-based non-pyro dual deployment. <br>
This computer uses a Seeedstudio ESP32-C3, TE MS5611 Barometer, u-blox MAX-M10S GPS module, and built in support for an external UART telemetry module, such as the HC-12 inlcuded with the computer from our shop.<br>

✅ 10cm Altitude accuarcy<br>
✅ GPS built-in<br>
✅ UART telemetry support<br>
✅ 32-bit ARM<br>
✅ 2 servo deployment channels<br>

# Update: Hank R2 development is under way, and will use a cheaper GPS with a built-in antenna, and remove the EEPROM chip in favour of onboard storage,  and a Moses computer that consist of breakouts and pyro channels, while the Hank line will continue to focus on dual deployment
